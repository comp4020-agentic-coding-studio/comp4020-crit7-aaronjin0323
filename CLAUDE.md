# COMP4020 prototype

A full-stack COMP4020 prototype: Astro rendering on the server, Drizzle over
SQLite, deployed to Fly.io as one machine with one volume. The deployed app is
what gets marked, not this repo.

The
[course website](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/)
publishes this deliverable's brief and spec, and this repo's name tells you
which deliverable applies. Read both before you plan or build.

## How to work in here

- Keep the dev server running (`pnpm dev`) so you see changes as you make them.
- Run `pnpm check` before you commit.
- Open the page in a browser and look at it. The rendered page is the truth;
  your mental model of it isn't.
- When a check fails, read its output before you change anything.
- Never commit a red state.
- **Commit freely; ask before every push and every deploy.** Small commits as
  each piece works are the process record the spec reads, so don't batch them.
  Pushing and deploying are the outward-facing steps: ask each time, and one
  yes doesn't cover the next.

## The database

- **The schema is the ground truth.** Change `src/lib/schema.ts`, run
  `pnpm db:generate`, and commit the schema and the migration it writes
  together. Never hand-edit the database, and never edit a migration that has
  been committed --- write a new one.
- **The deployed volume outlives every deploy.** A migration runs against
  whatever state production already holds, not an empty file. New `NOT NULL`
  columns need a default; renames and drops need a thought about the rows
  already there. The local `.data/` database is not evidence that a migration
  is safe.
- **Reference data comes from a source, never from memory.** Anything that
  stands for a real-world fact (times, places, codes) is generated from a
  recorded source by a committed script. If the source doesn't say it, the app
  doesn't claim it.

## The platform

- **CI probes `/api/events` after every deploy** and fails if it doesn't
  stream. Keep the SSE endpoint alive, whatever else changes.
- **Forms work without JavaScript:** a plain `POST` answered with a `303`
  redirect back to a page that re-renders from the database. Script can
  enhance that; it can't be the only path.
- **Astro refuses a form POST without a same-origin `Origin` header** (CSRF
  protection). Browsers send it; a bare `fetch` in a test doesn't, so tests
  must set it. Never turn the check off to make a test pass.
- **The invariants only visit the routes in `spec/routes.ts`.** Add every new
  static page there. A dynamic route (`/things/[id]`) has nothing to visit in
  the throwaway test database, so a spec test creates the record and runs the
  same checks on it.
- **After a deploy, fetch the URL and read the status.** The deploy command
  finishing is not the site answering.

## The checks

`pnpm check` runs them, and `pnpm check:evidence` is the extra gate before you
ship. CI runs the same plus secrets, the deploy, and the post-deploy probes.

`spec/README.md`, `PROCESS.md` and `reflections/README.md` are in this repo and
say what they are for.

## Things this stack keeps getting wrong

Carried forward from previous weeks --- general lessons about web work with
these tools, not tied to any one prototype's content.

- **axe reports contrast over a gradient as "incomplete", not "pass".** Don't
  read a low/zero violation count as real coverage; measure the rendered pixel
  directly when the background isn't flat.
- `agent-browser`'s `is visible` is an in-viewport check, not a
  `display`/`visibility` check --- a perfectly visible element below the fold
  reads as `false`. Assert on `getComputedStyle(...).display` via `eval`
  instead.
- `agent-browser batch` takes an array of *arg arrays* on stdin
  (`["set","viewport","1920","1080"]`, not `"set viewport 1920 1080"`), and
  there's no `--file` flag --- generate the JSON and pipe it.
- **Reusing a port serves the browser a stale page.** Append a
  `?v=<timestamp>` cache-buster to the URL, or a previous run on that port will
  happily confirm a version of the page you deleted.
- **`[].every()` is `true`, so a probe over an empty list is a false pass.**
  Any "all of them are fine" assertion has to assert a non-zero count first
  (`items.length > 0 && …`).
- **A CSS `transform` overrides an SVG `transform` attribute on the same
  element** --- it doesn't compose with it. Put a static transform on an outer
  `<g>` and animate a child inside it instead.
- **A flex `flex-basis` is a width in a row layout and a height once a media
  query stacks it into a column.** Reset it to `flex: 0 0 auto` in the stacked
  layout rather than letting the row value leak through.
- **A sticky bar above a `100svh` hero overflows the first screen by exactly
  the bar's height.** Hold the bar height in one custom property and use it
  both to shrink the hero (`calc(100svh - var(--nav-h))`) and to offset anchor
  targets (`scroll-margin-top`), so overriding it once at a breakpoint updates
  every use.
- **Measure the phone fold; don't reason about it.** Check where a control and
  the thing it changes actually land at 390x844 before redesigning around a
  problem that measuring might show doesn't exist.
- **`transform: scale(var(--x))` transitions fine with an *unregistered*
  custom property** --- the transition is declared on `transform`, and `var()`
  is substituted at computed-value time. `@property` is only needed to
  transition the custom property itself.
- **Gradients don't interpolate.** A transition can't animate
  `background-image`; crossfade stacked layers on `opacity` instead.
- **Position and size have to live on separate elements when scaling
  something.** `translate()` then `scale()` on one element means the *size*
  decides where it lands. Split into a positioning wrapper and a scaling
  child.
- **A dimension in `vw` with an offset in `vh` (or vice versa) needs a
  separate override per viewport shape** --- it can't be derived once and
  reused, because the two units don't track each other across aspect ratios.
- **A fully green browser suite says nothing about whether the page looks
  right.** Assertions cover behaviour; only reading the screenshot covers
  design. Budget a look at the image as a separate step, not as a formality
  after the checks pass.
- **You cannot judge small artwork in a full-page screenshot.** Screenshot the
  *element* with `deviceScaleFactor: 4` (and `reducedMotion: "reduce"`, or an
  opacity animation captures mid-fade) when the detail is the thing being
  checked, and budget several look-fix rounds, not one.
- **`visibility: hidden` takes an element out of hit-testing**, so a harness
  that hides the page before capturing it can't also click a control hidden
  that way. Interact first, then hide, then capture --- and hash output files
  before trusting a sweep that looks suspiciously uniform.
- **A suite of rules can be green while the rules add up to something
  impossible.** When the artefact has a success condition --- a game to win, a
  flow to complete, a form to get to the end of --- attempt the whole thing end
  to end and *measure* it. Assertions cover rules; only an end-to-end attempt
  covers whether the rules compose.
- **Attribute a symptom before tuning anything.** Log which specific source
  causes each instance of the problem before changing numbers. One diagnostic
  pass beats three rounds of guessing.
- **Two files agreeing on a string is a fact a test can hold, even when the
  thing it controls isn't testable.** A stylesheet selecting `[x="lost"]` and
  the code writing `"loss"` is a bug no assertion about colour could ever
  catch --- but "every value the CSS selects is a value the code writes" is
  mechanical. Same shape for routes and links, or a data attribute and its
  consumer.
- **A regression test written after the fix has never been seen to fail.**
  Reintroduce the bug, watch it go red, then restore.
- **`toContain` on a string is a substring check, and it makes a regression
  test toothless.** Assert the *shape* you actually care about (a regex, a
  parsed DOM query) and prove it fails both ways.
- **Two single-class CSS rules have equal specificity, so the later one wins
  silently.** When a class is meant for one context, scope it to that context
  (`.actor .fig`) rather than relying on where it happens to sit in the file.
- **A state-modifier class that shares a name with a component inherits the
  component's layout.** Namespace modifiers (`.is-boss`), and check every
  class the code toggles against the bare component selectors in the
  stylesheet.
- **A re-export nothing imports is dead weight, and its comment is often
  wrong.** Grep the symbol before believing the comment justifying it.
- **A fix can remove the symptom by adding an exception the user cannot see.**
  Ask of any rule change: *can the person using this read it off the screen?*
  If not, fix the composition instead of the rule.
- **Scraped text carries characters that look like ASCII and aren't.** A
  non-breaking hyphen (U+2011) in `32‑36` splits on nothing a plain `-` split
  finds. Normalise scraped input at the boundary and test the parser on the
  raw bytes, not a retyped sample.
- **A flex column shrinks an `overflow: hidden` child to nothing.** Its
  automatic minimum size drops to zero, so the one line a small box must
  never lose disappears first. Give children `flex: none` (or `min-height`)
  when the box is fixed-height.
- **Headless Chrome's `--window-size` has a minimum width**, so a "390px"
  screenshot is really wider and reports overflow that isn't there. Emulate
  the viewport through CDP (`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`, `mobile`
  on) and check `scrollWidth` against it.
- **A recorded "source" field is not necessarily a bare URL.** Notes get
  appended to it. Anything that turns data into an `href` extracts and tests
  the URL shape, or the link checker finds it after the deploy.

## Shell

- **zsh does not word-split unquoted parameter expansions.** `set -- $CFG` and
  `for x in $LIST` silently see one word, so a sweep written the bash way runs
  once with a corrupted argument instead of failing. Use a zsh array
  (`arr=(${=CFG})`) or drive the loop from `python3`/a heredoc.
- **`===` is not a separator in zsh** --- `echo ===` tries to expand `==` as a
  command lookup and fails the whole line. Quote decorative separators.

## Working style

- **A re-theme is CSS-only, not a rewrite.** When asked to restyle or re-theme
  a page, change presentation (styles, and only the markup needed to carry new
  classes/structure) and leave existing body text exactly as written. If a
  style genuinely can't be expressed without a structural change, raise that
  as a separate call-out rather than folding a silent content edit into the
  restyle.
- **Model the slice, not the system.** Build the one flow the brief names, end
  to end, before widening anything. A feature not in the slice is a line in
  the README's "chose not to build", not a half-finished page.

## This file is yours

What you add to it is the harness, and the harness is assessed. This file and
the sensors you wire into `check` carry across the course. The prototype
doesn't: source, and the tests answering this week's published spec, stay
behind. `spec/README.md` draws the line.
